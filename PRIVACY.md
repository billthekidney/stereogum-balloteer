The Stereogum-Balloteer extension ("the extension") just reorders the comment-voting buttons by putting the score between the up-vote and down-vote buttons, instead of to the right of the down-vote button.

With one exception, the extension doesn't transmit any information from any electronic devices to any others.  The exception is that the extension automatically fires the "LOAD MORE" button to load the second batch of comments into the user's browser about 5 seconds after the browser shows the first comment.

The extension doesn't require any kind of registration to be used. It doesn't care who uses it.

No Personal Identifying Information (PII) is collected at any time.

If the extension does not see the expected input, it bails out with a message to the browser's log console. There should be no reason for the extension to remove any text from the browser's page content that it operates on.

Of course, any user of this extension assumes the usual liability.

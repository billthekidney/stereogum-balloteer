This extension just reorders the comment-voting buttons by putting the score between the up-vote and down-vote buttons, instead of to the right of the down-vote button.

The extension doesn't transmit any information from any electronic devices to any others.

The extension doesn't require any kind of registration to be used. It doesn't care who uses it.

No Personal Identifying Information (PII) is collected at any time.

If the extension does not see the expected input text, it bails out with a message to the browser's log console. It tries not to remove other text accidentally.

Of course, any user of this extension assumes the usual liability.
